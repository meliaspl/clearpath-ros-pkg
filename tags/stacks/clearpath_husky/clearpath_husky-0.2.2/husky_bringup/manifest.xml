  <description brief="husky_bringup">

     This package provides a launch file to bring up the Husky
     hardware interface in a way that will be accessible and
     usable by the other software in husky_teleop and husky_kinect.

     In the future, a script will be provided to allow this to
     be controlled by the service command and launched on startup
     of your machine.
