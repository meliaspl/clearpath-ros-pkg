    The clearpath_husky stack provides a central repository of software
    and launch files intended for deployment on the Clearpath Robotics
    Husky A100 and A200 robots.

    With a joystick, try running:

      roslaunch husky_teleop teleop.launch

    With a Kinect, try exploring or following people:

      roslaunch husky_kinect explore.launch
      roslaunch husky_kinect track_person.launch

    The kinect demos will require installation of the openni_kinect stack:

      sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-openni-kinect
