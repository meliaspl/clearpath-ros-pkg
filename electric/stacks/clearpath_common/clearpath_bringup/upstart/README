Upstart scripts for Clearpath Robotics platforms.
Based on the turtlebot_bringup package.

Installation:

install.bash [interface] [user] [launch_pkg]

Ex: sudo ./install.bash eth0 administrator husky_bringup

This will run on startup the minimal.launch file in husky_bringup. The service
may be stopped and started:

sudo service clearpath start
sudo service clearpath stop

Logs of upstart activity will be in /tmp/clearpath-upstart.log.

ROS logs will be in their usual location, execute roslaunch-logs to get the
logdir of the currently running roscore.


NOTES:
- System will be launched as user administrator without any group memberships,
  most critically the dialout group. Any serial ports being used will need to
  have their owner set to the user, or permissions set to world read/write.
- Launch file run on startup is stored in /etc/ros/electric/clearpath.launch.
- To disable starting the clearpath service automatically on the network
  interface coming up, edit /etc/init/clearpath.conf, and comment out the 
  "start on" and "stop on" lines.
- System assumes that any non-apt ROS packages will be in /home/$user/ros. To 
  change this, edit /etc/ros/setup.bash (generated by install.bash)
