Where did the packages go?
--------------------------

When we reorganized our source code, it turned out that we didn't 
need the clearpath_platform stack anymore. We've moved the
clearpath_base and clearpath_teleop packages to a new stack
called clearpath_common, and we've put launchers and demos specific
to our platforms in clearpath_husky, clearpath_kingfisher, and
clearpath_turtlebot. Those stacks are the best starting point
for getting going with our platforms.

If you were previously using packages from clearpath_platform, it
should be a seamless transition to clearpath_common. Just check the
new stacks out to a location in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and
roslaunch will find them as before.

Please let us know if you have any questions!
